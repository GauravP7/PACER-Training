### Steps followed for pacer training site extraction:

1. Learnt about Python - Difference with other languages, differnce between tuples and lists, difference between a method and a function, difference between a parameter and an argument, GIL, multithreading, Regex, copy package and old and new style class.
2. Learnt about Django – overview, features and working with the Model-View-Template architecture.
3. Learnt about Celery - Overview.
4. Learnt what is PACER - its uses and how to use it.
5. Created the Requirements analysis document (RAD) by studying the PACER site and its working.
6. Created the Functional Design Document (FDD) by listing the abilities the program must possess.
7. Learnt about MySQL - its different engine types, Collation and Character set, difference between Text and JSON datatypes.
8. Brushed up on different normal forms in DBMS and learnt to create a normalized database.
9. Created the Implementation Design Document (IDD) with the functional and Non functional requirements of the program.
10. Created a detailed database schema with the Entity-Relationship diagram and Relational-Schema diagram, along with the code f for the tables of the database.
11. Set up the virtual environment and Git in my local sustem.
12. Wrote the detailed steps (algorithm) to code the extraction and storing of the case details from the PACER training site.
13. Learnt how to login and query the case details from the PACER training site.
14. Learnt to pack the case details using the concept of tuple packing and unpacking.
15. Refactored the code by instantiatiing it (adding the 'class' representation and hence implemented the OOP approach.
16. Split the code into two files - one file contained the class definitions wirh the required mwthods and the other file contained the flow of excution of the program as per the detailed steps.
17. Performed memory profiling of if-else v. try-catch block to compare the memory consumption and time taken by these two programming constructs.
18. Implemented the earlier designed schema and created the database.
19. Stored the extracted case details into the database.
20. Implemented the Django models and views to Displayed the stored data from the database.
