<h1>Steps followed for pacer training site extraction:</h1>

<p> Scrape the PACER training website and collect case related information </p>
<hr/>

<ul>
  <li>
       Learnt about Python - Difference with other languages, differnce between tuples and lists, difference between a method and a function, difference between a parameter and an argument, GIL, multithreading, Regex, copy package and old and new style class.
  </li>
  <li>Learnt about Celery - Overview.</li>
  <li>Learnt about Django â€“ overview, features and working with the Model-View-Template architecture.</li>
  <li>Learnt what is PACER - its uses and how to use it.</li>
  <li>Created the Requirements analysis document (RAD) by studying the PACER site and its working.</li>
  <li>Created the Functional Design Document (FDD) by listing the abilities the program must possess.</li>
  <li>Learnt about MySQL - its different engine types, Collation and Character set, difference between Text and JSON datatypes.</li>
  <li>Brushed up on different normal forms in DBMS and learnt to create a normalized database.</li>
  <li>Created the Implementation Design Document (IDD) with the functional and Non functional requirements of the program.</li>
  <li>Created a detailed database schema with the Entity-Relationship diagram and Relational-Schema diagram, along with the code f for the tables of the database.
    </li>
  <li>Set up the virtual environment and Git in my local sustem.</li>
  <li>Wrote the detailed steps (algorithm) to code the extraction and storing of the case details from the PACER training site.</li>
  <li>Learnt how to login and query the case details from the PACER training site.</li>
  <li>Learnt to pack the case details using the concept of tuple packing and unpacking.</li>
  <li>Performed memory profiling of if-else v. try-catch block to compare the memory consumption and time taken by these two programming constructs.
    </li>
  <li>Implemented the earlier designed schema and created the database.</li>
  <li>Stored the extracted case details into the database.</li>
  <li>Implemented the Django models and views to Displayed the stored data from the database.</li>
